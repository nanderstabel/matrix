# matrix

This repository consists of a collection of exercises related to **Linear Algebra** and **Matrices**, both of which are very important theories in both mathematics and computer science.

The following binaries can be build and run:

```
add_subtract_scale
linear_combination
linear_interpolation
dot_product
norm
cosine
cross_product
linear_map
trace
transpose
row_echelon
determinant
inverse
rank
projection_matrix
```

Example:
```
cargo run --release --bin dot_product
```

To run tests for a specific binary:
```
cargo test --bin dot_product
```

To run all tests at once:
```
cargo test
```

Checkout the docs:
```
cargo doc --open
```
